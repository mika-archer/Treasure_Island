# Treasure_Island

Control flow and logical operators.

Practice with if, else, and elif.

> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equal to
!= not equal to

if, else, and elif all must evaluate to True or False or Other (that has been taken into account on)

% gives you the remainder after a division (= modulo)

Nested if - else statements check if subconditions happen in mulitple True or False conditions

elif is else if which is True - False or False - True (kind of an overflow catcher)

Multiple if statements are for when multiple conditions need to be True but if-elif-else is for when only one need to be True. Nested if statements need to be at the same indentation of each other.

Not all if statements require an accompanying else statement.

Can check for multiple conditions in the same line with the logical operator [and], [or], and [not].

Treasure_Island is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type of situation.

If necessary: a \ added into a str with grammatically correct sympbols will help the flow without having to constantly edit.
